## Revenue of NYC during and before COVID-19
I gathered data that provided me details on the revenue NYC earned during previous years, including when COVID-19 hit. As you all know, Hunter College closed it's doors at around March 2020 and there was a 2 week lockdown imposed on many citizens. As such, for 2020's tax revenue I expected to see quite a decrease in revenue. However, the data I've gathered shows otherwise.

Below is a graph of the mean actual NYC revenue annually. (This graph is the combined results of various sectors of tax revenue which includes: )
